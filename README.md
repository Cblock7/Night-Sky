# Night-Sky

## Description

This project is a web application that displays where the International Space Station is currently orbiting on a map compared to where the user is located.

The motivation for this project was to create an original web application that provides information for a user with the utilization of server-side APIs. This group project tested our abilities to incorparate in-class materials while using the git flow process to merge our content.

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, and server-side APIs are the technology makeup for the project.

## Installation

No special steps for installation as this project is a web application that runs via browser.

## Usage

Upon launching the web application, users simply need to enter their physical street address into the applicable search fields and click "Find the ISS". The map will then display your location and its relation to the International Space Station!

## Credit

Our project was made possible by utilization of the API from Open Notify (http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/) and the API from Geocode xyz (https://geocode.xyz/). We also enlisted the Open Street Map (https://www.openstreetmap.org/) to verify user coordinates for the location process.
